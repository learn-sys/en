# Proposal for a Systems Reading Group

We propose a reading group on the purpose of advanced systems education. In this reading group, group members read and present important papers in the field of computer systems.

## Rule

* This event will be held once a week.
* During each event, two teams (with two people in each team) will present.
* Each team will present one of the system papers listed below. They will have twenty minutes for the presentation. During the 20-minute presentation, both team members should talk for longer than 5 minutes.
* After the presentation, there will be a 20-minute Q&A and 20-minute group discussion (with up to 6 people in each group). During the Q&A, everyone is encouraged to ask questions and give comments. If noone volunteers, the host of the event will decide who to talk next.
* Before each event, the presenters should upload their slides to this website. The slides should be open-cource under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licenses. The presenters are expected to create the slide themselves; however, they may use any data, text, figure, or code in the original paper.
* Before each event, members of the reading group should study the materials listed below, including watching videos and reading papers.
* Because it is hard to discuss with hundreds of people, this event has a prerequest. To join the group, one need to finish at least 60% of labs of an operating systems course where they are required to implement a whole hardware-bootable operating system from scratch (such as MIT 6.S081).
* The reading group only has 40 slots. If more than 40 people are qualified, they should be splitted into multiple groups.

## Paper List and Schedule
### W0: Icebreaking

* Introduce yourself, find a teammate, and have fun.

### W1: Operating Systems

### W6: FPGA and GPU

* What's the best paper for FPGA? AmorphOS, Coyote, Cascade, or Catapult?
* What's the best paper for GPU/CUDA?

### W7: Networking
* Infiniswap?
* What's the best networking paper to read? Find one from Facebook?

### W8: Machine Learning
