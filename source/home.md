# The Club of A Bunch of Labs and Papers

Computer systems education is done with tons of **labs** and **paper readings**. In this website, we aim at providing a platform for people to work on the labs and read the papers together.

[OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) is a great community providing the a complete computer science education stack. **We are not OSSU.** If you are looking for a complete education in computer science, please visit their website and join their discord channels.

This website, however, is designed for people who want to fight against the **labs** from different computer systems courses, as well as people who have gotten the labs done and want to read some **papers** in the systems field. Like OSSU, we provide chatrooms for different courses; unlike OSSU, we have a hard prerequest for all chatrooms --- we require you to finish part of the labs before joining us. More details regarding the prerequest can be found in each course page. Besides, in order to join a reading group which has limited slots, you need to finish at least **60%** labs of a related course.

## Courses and Activities

**None of the following is ready, we need volunteers to build them.**

* CMU CSAPP: Introduction to Computer Systems :fire:
* MIT 6.S081/6.828: Build the OS Yourself
* MIT 6.824: Distributed System
* Reading Group

## Call for Attendees

We encourage everyone who has passion with computer systems to join the community. The links for chatrooms are published in each course page.

## Call for Volunteers

We need volunteers to create chatrooms for people to communicate, update this website, and build the whole community. If you are interested, feel free to submit [Pull Requests](https://github.com/learn-sys/en/pulls) or ask us to add you to the GitHub organization via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/learn-sys/en/issues).
